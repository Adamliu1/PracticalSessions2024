# [[EEML2024](https://www.eeml.eu)] Tutorial 2: Reinforcement Learning

**Authors:** Andreea Deac and Ognjen MilinkoviÄ‡

--- 

This tutorial will explore policy-based reinforcement learning agents, starting from a random agent in a grid-like environment and finishing with fine-tuning a pre-trained language model in the style of RLHF.
