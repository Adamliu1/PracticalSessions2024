# [[EEML2024](https://www.eeml.eu)] Tutorial 4: Geometric Deep Learning

**Authors:** Iulia Duta and Vladimir MirjaniÄ‡

--- 

### Outline

This tutorial is meant to be a stand-alone introduction into the Graph Neural Network world. You will learn about the basics of working with graph data, implementing a standard Graph Network architecture and understand more about current challenges and open research problems in the field such as rewiring and positional encoding.

In this tutorial you will:


1. Implement both a sparse and a dense version of **Graph Convolutional Network in Pytorch**.
2. Write a training pipeline for graph inputs including **graph-level representation** and **custom mini-batching**.
3. Improve the Graph Convolutional Network using attention mechanisms - **Graph Attention Network**.
4. Make our first steps into **Pytorch Geometric**, a library dedicated to geometric deep learning.
5. Re-implement **Graph Attention Network in Pytorch Geometric**.
6. Understand the **over-squashing challenge** and experiment with **two graph rewiring techniques**: Graph Transformer and Expander Graph Propagation.
7. Explore various **positional encodings** for graph data.
